## 1.6 Specificity

In this part we will learn about selector specificity, one of the core features of CSS.

### Selector Specificity

There are five levels of specificity in CSS:

* CSS rules followed by `!important`
* Inline CSS using the `style` attribute
* `ID` Selectors
* `Class` Selectors \(also includes pseudo class selectors and `attribute` selectors\)
* `Element` Selectors \(also includes pseudo element selectors\)

To find out if your selector is more specific than another selector the guys of [css-tricks](http://www.css-tricks.com) came up with following formula:

You start with five zero's, one for each level of specificity and then for every part of your selector you increase the zero of the corresponding level. Eventually the selector with the highest specificity score will win. If both selectors have an equal specificity, the cascading rule applies.

| !important | inline | id | class | element |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Best practise is to use class selectors as much as possible. You often don't want to style every element of a certain type but you do want to target more than one element, therefor class selectors are the appropriate selectors in most cases.

#### Example

```css
div {
    color: #0f0; // 0 0 0 0 1
}

.foo {
    color: #f00; // 0 0 0 1 0
}

#bar {
    color: #00f; // 0 0 1 0 0
}

#bar.foo {
    color: #bada55; // 0 0 1 1 0
}
```

```markup
<p id="bar" class="foo">I am #bada55.</p>
```
